Brisk
=====

Brisk is a modern forum built on Django, Angular.js and off-the-shelf components. 

The Django portion of Brisk is quite dumb, and is meant only to power the RESTful endpoints that are to be consumed by
the Angular frontend.  Not currently included is the Angular code that powers this, but that will come shortly.
